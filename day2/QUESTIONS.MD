Answer 1:

The ledger canister on the ICP (Internet Computer) blockchain is controlled by a network of validator nodes. These nodes are responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain's ledger. The network is decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls the ledger canister or the ICP blockchain as a whole. Instead, it is maintained and governed by a community of participants.

Answer 2:

There are 16 nodes

Answer 3:

This is because the dissolve delay is set at 4 years and your neuron has been locked for 2 years. So, you have 2 more years before your ICPs are fully dissolved and you can access your full voting power. Since each ICP represents a 1% voting power, with 10 ICPs, you would have 10% voting power. But since your ICPs are locked for 2 more years, you only have access to half of your voting power, which is 5%.

Answer 4:

The Nat.toText(m) function call is missing a return statement. Without a return statement, the function will not return a value and will not work as intended.

Answer 5: 

The variable languages is declared as var but it is an array of strings which should be immutable. Instead, it should be declared as let or const to prevent modification.

Answer 6:

The := operator is used to assign a value to a variable, but the languages variable is declared as var which means it is already assigned a value and cannot be reassigned. Instead, the code should use the += operator to add the new language to the existing array. Additionally, the Array.append<Text> function should not be used, instead the new language can simply be added to the array using the += operator.
