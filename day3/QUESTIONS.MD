Answer 1:

The ledger canister on the ICP (Internet Computer) blockchain is controlled by a network of validator nodes. These nodes are responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain's ledger. The network is decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls the ledger canister or the ICP blockchain as a whole. Instead, it is maintained and governed by a community of participants.
